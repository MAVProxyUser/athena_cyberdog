It is recommended that using `ament_lint`(https://github.com/ament/ament_lint) tool or `colcon test` to check before submitting the code.

## Branch management

All our repositories are divided into two branches for development, which are `devel` and `master`.

- The `devel` branch is a development branch and it is used for daily merge requests and bundle repositories.
- The `master` branch is used to store the stable version. If and only when a new version needs to be released, freeze the `devel` branch and create a merge request from the `devel` branch, and perform the following steps:
 1. Modify `CHANGELOG`, sort out new features and pre-fixed bugs in the pre-release, and determine the release version.
 2. Pass by CI, including construction and testing. 
 3. The test engineer will fully test the new functions and issues proposed in the step 1. If there is a problem, the relevant developers are required to submit the repair code to the `devel` branch timely according to the method of fixing the problem.
 4. If step 3 is passed, the code and binary package of the project will be packaged and encapsulated.
 5. Release in the interface.
